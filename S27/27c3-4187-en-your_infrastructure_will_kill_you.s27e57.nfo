  <plot>The past century our infrastructure has seen both massive expansion and heavy centralization.  When it fails, it fails big -- this is the reality of our modern interconnectedness.  We live in a world of crumbling bridges and bankrupt states, and our infrastructure will kill us.  The people weâ€™re relying on to keep us safe are trying to accomplish long-term risk management with short-term thinking.  So, what now?  We can't opt out, but we can become more resilient, and we can start thinking about risk differently.</plot>
